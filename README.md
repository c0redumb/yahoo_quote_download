# yahoo_quote_download

## Introduction
This project is for downloading Yahoo financial EOD (End-of-Day) data of stock and market indexes.

## Background
Yahoo has provided the EOD financial data service for a long time and it has been well-used. However, starting on May 2017, Yahoo financial has terminated that service without warning. This is confirmed by a Yahoo employee in forum posts.

However, it is later found that despite that the service has been terminated, the Yahoo financial EOD data is still available, though with some authentication steps added and some changes in format. The [technical details](https://github.com/c0redumb/yahoo_quote_download/blob/master/details.md) are described in a separate document.

This project provides a way to continue obtaining the same data.
